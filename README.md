=========================

Kata about metaprogamming in Ruby, consisting of implementing some design patterns

# GOF Patterns

  * Singleton
    * Minimum requirement: allow any class to understand a ```singletonize``` message, which adds to it a instance/get_instance method, which returns always the same instance of the class. 
    * Extra requirements: 
       * remove, hide or rename the new method. 
       * implement trivial - nont thread safe - lazy loading
       * allow to parameterize the get_instance selector
   * Decorator
   * NullObject

# Non GOF Patterns
   * Pattern Matching
   * Multimethod
